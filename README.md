# MHW Database Personal Project
A personal project which I created to learn Angular + a bit of Node/Express.

Ultimately, this site will contain a database of all MHWorld Items/Weapons/Skills/Armor/etc. If time allows, I would like to add a build calculator to test out a variety of builds and possibly share them with other users.

Right now in a very rough state but working on getting it to look decent before I host it anywhere.
